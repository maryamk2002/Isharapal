IMPORTANT NOTES FOR YOUR ABSTRACT
================================================================================

Your abstract should include (in order):

1. INTRODUCTION (2-3 sentences):
   "Pakistan Sign Language (PSL) serves as the primary communication medium
   for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community in Pakistan, yet faces 
   significant barriers due to limited understanding among the general 
   population. This project presents a real-time PSL recognition system 
   capable of translating 40 Urdu alphabet signs into text using deep 
   learning techniques."

2. METHODOLOGY (3-4 sentences):
   "The system employs a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) architecture
   with MediaPipe-based hand landmark extraction. Training was performed on
   23,258 samples with weighted loss and data augmentation. The TCN model
   comprises five convolutional layers [256,256,256,256,128] with 124-frame
   receptive field."

3. RESULTS (2-3 sentences):
   "The trained model achieved 97.17% accuracy on the test set with 1.42s
   average latency. Stability filtering using 3/5 majority voting eliminates
   prediction flickering while maintaining real-time performance."

4. CONCLUSION (1-2 sentences):
   "The developed PSL recognition system successfully bridges the 
   communication gap between the deaf community and the general population.
   The high accuracy combined with real-time performance makes it suitable
   for practical deployment in educational institutions and public services."
