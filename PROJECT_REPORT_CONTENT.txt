ABSTRACT
================================================================================

Pakistan Sign Language (PSL) serves as the primary communication medium for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community in Pakistan, yet faces significant barriers due to limited understanding among the general population. This project presents a real-time PSL recognition system capable of translating 40 Urdu alphabet signs into text using deep learning techniques. The system employs a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) architecture with MediaPipe-based hand landmark extraction for feature representation.

The implementation consists of a full-stack web application with a Python Flask backend utilizing PyTorch for model inference and a Next.js React frontend for user interaction. The system processes video input through a webcam, extracts 189-dimensional hand landmark features (21 landmarks per hand × 3 coordinates × 2 hands + padding), and applies a sliding window approach with temporal smoothing for stable real-time predictions. The TCN model architecture comprises five convolutional layers with channels [256, 256, 256, 256, 128], kernel size of 5, and dropout regularization of 0.4. Training was performed on a dataset of 23,258 samples with weighted loss to handle class imbalance, employing data augmentation techniques including temporal shifts, landmark noise injection, and geometric transformations.

The trained model achieved 97.17% accuracy on the test set (3,431 correct predictions out of 3,531 samples) with consistent performance across all 40 sign classes. The system demonstrates real-time inference capability with a 32-frame sliding window requiring only 1.07 seconds for prediction, significantly faster than traditional 60-frame approaches. Stability filtering using majority voting (3/5 consensus) eliminates prediction flickering while maintaining responsiveness. The system automatically resets its buffer when hands disappear from the frame, preventing stale predictions.

The developed PSL recognition system successfully bridges the communication gap between the deaf community and the general population in Pakistan. The high accuracy combined with real-time performance makes it suitable for practical deployment in educational institutions, public service centers, and mobile applications. Future enhancements include word-level and sentence-level recognition, support for dynamic signs with motion, and integration with text-to-speech for bidirectional communication.

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION
================================================================================

1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sign language serves as the primary mode of communication for millions of deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals worldwide. In Pakistan, Pakistan Sign Language (PSL) is used by an estimated 250,000 to 500,000 individuals. Despite its significance, PSL remains largely unknown to the general hearing population, creating substantial communication barriers in education, healthcare, employment, and social integration.

Traditional sign language interpretation requires trained human interpreters who are scarce and expensive, limiting accessibility for the deaf community. The advent of computer vision and deep learning technologies has opened new possibilities for automated sign language recognition systems that can bridge this communication gap.

Recent advances in deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs), have demonstrated remarkable success in spatial-temporal pattern recognition tasks. These architectures can learn hierarchical representations from sequential data, making them suitable for gesture recognition. Furthermore, the development of efficient hand pose estimation systems like MediaPipe enables real-time extraction of hand landmarks with minimal computational overhead.

This project leverages these technological advances to develop a real-time PSL recognition system focused on the 40 Urdu alphabet signs. The system aims to provide an accessible, accurate, and responsive tool that can facilitate communication between the deaf community and the general population in Pakistan.


1.2 PROBLEM STATEMENT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The deaf and hard-of-hearing community in Pakistan faces significant communication barriers due to the limited understanding of Pakistan Sign Language among the general population. Several key problems exist:

1. SCARCITY OF INTERPRETERS: Professional PSL interpreters are few in number and concentrated in urban areas, making their services inaccessible to most of the deaf community.

2. HIGH COST OF INTERPRETATION SERVICES: Human interpretation services are expensive, creating financial barriers for routine communication needs.

3. LIMITED AWARENESS: The general population lacks knowledge of PSL, resulting in social isolation and limited opportunities for deaf individuals in education and employment.

4. ABSENCE OF TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS: Unlike American Sign Language (ASL) or British Sign Language (BSL), PSL has minimal technological support with few automated recognition systems available.

5. REAL-TIME COMMUNICATION CHALLENGES: Existing research prototypes often suffer from slow inference times, limited vocabulary, and poor accuracy, making them impractical for real-world use.

6. URDU ALPHABET RECOGNITION GAP: Most sign language recognition systems focus on English alphabets, leaving Urdu-specific signs underrepresented in research and applications.

This project addresses these problems by developing a real-time, accurate, and accessible PSL recognition system that can translate Urdu alphabet signs instantaneously, providing a technological bridge for communication.


1.3 MOTIVATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The motivation for this project stems from multiple factors:

SOCIAL IMPACT: Enabling better communication for Pakistan's deaf community can dramatically improve their quality of life, educational opportunities, and social integration. By providing a tool that anyone can use without specialized training, the system democratizes access to PSL understanding.

TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT: Deep learning has revolutionized computer vision, yet its application to PSL remains limited. This project contributes to the growing field of assistive technologies while advancing the state of sign language recognition research specific to Pakistani languages.

ACCESSIBILITY: With the widespread availability of smartphones and webcams, a real-time PSL recognition system can be deployed at scale with minimal infrastructure requirements, making it accessible to both urban and rural populations.

EDUCATIONAL VALUE: The system can serve as a learning tool for individuals interested in learning PSL, providing instant feedback on sign accuracy and facilitating self-paced learning.

================================================================================
CHAPTER 2: BACKGROUND REVIEW
================================================================================

2.1 OVERVIEW OF SIGN LANGUAGE RECOGNITION SYSTEMS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sign language recognition (SLR) is a multidisciplinary field combining computer vision, machine learning, and linguistics to automatically interpret sign language gestures. SLR systems can be categorized into two main approaches:

VISION-BASED APPROACHES:
Vision-based systems use cameras to capture hand gestures and facial expressions. These systems analyze RGB images or depth data to extract features and recognize signs. Vision-based approaches offer non-intrusive, natural interaction but face challenges with varying lighting conditions, background clutter, and occlusion.

SENSOR-BASED APPROACHES:
Sensor-based systems use wearable devices like data gloves, accelerometers, or motion capture systems to track hand movements. While these provide precise measurements, they require specialized hardware and can be intrusive for users.

Modern SLR research predominantly focuses on vision-based approaches due to their accessibility and natural user experience. The field has evolved through several technological phases:

1. TRADITIONAL COMPUTER VISION (pre-2012): Hand-crafted features like HOG, SIFT, and color segmentation.
2. SHALLOW LEARNING (2012-2015): Support Vector Machines and Random Forests with engineered features.
3. DEEP LEARNING ERA (2015-present): Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, and Transformer architectures.


2.2 EXISTING APPROACHES AND SYSTEMS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE (ASL) RECOGNITION:
ASL has received the most research attention with numerous systems developed:
- Static alphabet recognition systems achieving 95-99% accuracy on controlled datasets.
- Dynamic sign recognition using LSTMs and 3D CNNs for temporal modeling.
- Commercial applications like SignAll and Microsoft's Sign Language Translator.

INDIAN SIGN LANGUAGE (ISL) RECOGNITION:
Research on ISL has grown significantly:
- CNN-based approaches for alphabets and numbers with 90-95% accuracy.
- LSTM models for continuous ISL recognition.
- Mobile applications for educational purposes.

PAKISTAN SIGN LANGUAGE (PSL) RECOGNITION:
Limited research exists on PSL specifically:
- Small-scale studies on PSL digit and alphabet recognition with limited datasets.
- Most systems report accuracy in the 80-90% range on small vocabularies.
- Lack of comprehensive, publicly available PSL datasets.
- Minimal deployment of practical systems for real-world use.

EXISTING LIMITATIONS:
1. Small datasets limiting model generalization.
2. Controlled environment testing with limited real-world validation.
3. High computational requirements preventing real-time deployment.
4. Focus on isolated signs rather than continuous signing.
5. Limited support for non-English sign languages.


2.3 TECHNOLOGIES USED IN DEEP LEARNING FOR GESTURE RECOGNITION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS (CNNs):
CNNs excel at extracting spatial features from images through hierarchical layers of convolution, pooling, and fully connected operations. For sign language recognition, 2D CNNs process individual frames while 3D CNNs capture both spatial and temporal information across frame sequences.

RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS (RNNs) AND LSTMs:
RNNs and their variants (LSTMs, GRUs) are designed for sequential data processing. They maintain hidden states that capture temporal dependencies, making them suitable for modeling the sequential nature of sign language gestures. However, they suffer from vanishing gradients and slow sequential processing.

TEMPORAL CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORKS (TCNs):
TCNs apply 1D convolutions across the temporal dimension with causal convolutions and dilated filters to capture long-range dependencies. Advantages over RNNs include:
- Parallel processing enabling faster training and inference.
- Stable gradients through residual connections.
- Flexible receptive field through dilation.
- Better performance on long sequences.

MEDIAPIPE HAND TRACKING:
MediaPipe is Google's open-source framework providing real-time hand landmark detection. It outputs 21 3D landmarks per hand with:
- High accuracy (pixel-level precision).
- Real-time performance (30+ FPS on CPU).
- Robust to lighting variations and occlusions.
- Lightweight model suitable for mobile devices.

TRANSFER LEARNING:
Pre-trained models on large-scale datasets (ImageNet, Kinetics) provide feature extractors that can be fine-tuned for sign language recognition with limited training data.

2.5 RESEARCH GAP AND IDENTIFIED NEED
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GAPS IN EXISTING RESEARCH:

1. LIMITED PSL RESEARCH: While ASL and ISL have extensive research, PSL remains underexplored with few comprehensive studies and datasets.

2. ACCURACY-SPEED TRADEOFF: Most high-accuracy systems sacrifice real-time performance, while fast systems compromise accuracy.

3. SMALL DATASETS: Existing PSL datasets are small (typically <5000 samples), limiting model generalization and performance.

4. CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENTS: Research typically focuses on controlled settings with uniform backgrounds and lighting, limiting real-world applicability.

5. LACK OF PRODUCTION SYSTEMS: Most PSL recognition research remains at the prototype stage without production-ready deployments.

6. CLASS IMBALANCE: Existing studies rarely address class imbalance in sign datasets, leading to biased performance.

7. TEMPORAL INSTABILITY: Many systems produce flickering predictions due to inadequate temporal smoothing.

IDENTIFIED NEEDS:

1. A production-ready PSL recognition system with high accuracy (>95%) and real-time performance (<2s latency).

2. Comprehensive dataset with sufficient samples per class and natural variations.

3. Robust model architecture that handles temporal dependencies effectively.

4. Practical deployment strategy accessible to general users without specialized hardware.

5. Systematic approach to handling class imbalance and ensuring consistent performance.

6. Temporal smoothing mechanism to produce stable, non-flickering predictions.

This project addresses these gaps by developing a TCN-based system achieving 97.17% accuracy with real-time inference, trained on 23,258 samples with comprehensive class balancing and temporal smoothing mechanisms.
